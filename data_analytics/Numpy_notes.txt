-> Numpy is a linear algebra library for python, the 
   reason it is so important for data science with 
   python is that almost all of the libraries in the 
   PyData Ecosystem rely on NumPy as one of their main 
   building blocks.

-> Numpy is also incredibly fast, as it has bindings to C libraries

-> Numpy arrays essentially come in two flavors
	1. Vectors
	2. Matrices

-> Vectors are strictly 1-d arrays and matrices are 2-d or 1-d
